# Flexr: **F**acebook Messenger **L**og **Ex**porte**r**

Logs Facebook Messenger chat logs to json files
(which I will figure out how to process into some nice-looking HTML/PDFs etc.)

## Usage
First, install all the dependencies with `npm install`.
Then run `login.js` first, and finally `index.js`.
